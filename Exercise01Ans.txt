1. Memoization is a technique that makes repeated calculations more efficient, this is due to storing the result of the previous results or a calculated function and using those results instead of recalculating the results or using them to get the next one.

2.Considered

3.This python function is makes calculated the nth fibonacci number using recursion

4.I think this is an example of divide and conquer alogrithm because it breaks the problem down into simpler calcuations

5. The Time complexities of the problem are O(n) or O(6)

9.The plot privides a very accurate and filled in with time version the the time complexity calculated. It is clear to understand what happened in the plot along with seeing outliers of the code. Meanwhile the one calcuated is gives a general rule as to what the time will take, not considering the small outliers or the randomness of memory usage on systems.
